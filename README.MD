This is my optional project for Launch School's RB175.  
I chose to make a pomodoro timer app with Sinatra.

Bit off a little more than I could chew.  Was able to create a timer of sorts with lots of googling, but to get the display and buttons correct I needed some Javascipt help from o3 mini.  

Still happy with what I've learnt this far in Launch School and while doing this project.  Looking forward to taking frontend courses soon!

Needed more help setting up Ajax as well.  Ajax is used to listen to the start and stop buttons and record time, data and task name into sessions when they are clicked.
