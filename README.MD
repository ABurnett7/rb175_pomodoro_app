This is my optional project for Launch School's RB175.  
I chose to make a pomodoro timer app with Sinatra.

Bit off a little more than I could chew.  Was able to create a timer of sorts with lots of googling, but to get the display and buttons correct I needed some Javascipt help from o3 mini.  

Still happy with what I've learnt this far in Launch School and while doing this project.  Looking forward to taking frontend courses soon!
